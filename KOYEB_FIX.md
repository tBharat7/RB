# Fixing Koyeb Deployment Health Check Issues

This guide addresses the specific health check failures you're experiencing with your Koyeb deployment.

## Problem Identified

From your logs, I can see:

```
TCP health check failed on port 8000.
```

This indicates that Koyeb is trying to check your server's health on port 8000, but your server is running on port 5000. This port mismatch is causing your deployment to fail even though your server is actually running.

## Changes Made to Fix the Issue

I've made the following changes to resolve the health check failures:

### 1. Updated Port Configuration

Updated `server.js` to use port 8000 (Koyeb's expected port):

```javascript
// Define port for Koyeb compatibility
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;
```

### 2. Added Multiple Health Check Endpoints

Added explicit health check endpoints for Koyeb:

```javascript
// Explicit health check endpoints for Koyeb
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' });
});

app.get('/healthz', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' });
});

app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' });
});
```

### 3. Added Koyeb Environment Detection

Added code to detect and configure for Koyeb:

```javascript
// Check for Koyeb environment
const isKoyebEnvironment = process.env.KOYEB_ENVIRONMENT === 'true' || !!process.env.KOYEB_PLATFORM;
if (isKoyebEnvironment) {
  console.log('Running in Koyeb environment');
  process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production';
}
```

### 4. Created Proper Koyeb Configuration

Created a `koyeb.yaml` file with:
- Correct port specifications (8000)
- Environment variables
- Health check configuration
- Service definition

### 5. Updated API URL Configuration

Updated the frontend API configuration to correctly connect to the Koyeb deployed backend.

## Deploying the Fixed Version

1. Push these changes to your repository
2. In the Koyeb dashboard:
   - Set the following environment variables:
     - `PORT`: `8000`
     - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
     - `KOYEB_ENVIRONMENT`: `true`
     - `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
     - `JWT_SECRET`: Your JWT secret

3. Specify that the health check should use the `/health` endpoint on port 8000

## Verifying the Fix

After deployment, you should see:
1. The application starts successfully
2. Health checks pass (green status in Koyeb dashboard)
3. Your API endpoints respond correctly

If you still encounter issues, check the Koyeb logs for error messages and make sure all environment variables are correctly set.
